# Student Gradebook Database (SQL Project)

This is a beginner-level SQL project that creates a simple gradebook system using MySQL. It includes tables for students, courses, and grades, with sample data and example queries to demonstrate data relationships and querying.

---

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

Download the student_db.sql.txt file from this repository.
(If the file ends in .sql.txt, you can rename it to just .sql for easier use.)

Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your local MySQL server.

In MySQL Workbench:

Go to File > Open SQL Script...

Select the student_db.sql or student_db.sql.txt file
(or open it in Notepad, copy the contents, and paste it into a new SQL tab in Workbench)

Click the ‚ö°Ô∏è lightning bolt button to execute the full script
(or run it section by section to follow along)

Once executed:
   - A database named `student_db` will be created
   - Three tables will be set up: `Students`, `Courses`, and `Grades`
   - Sample data will be inserted
   - Two example `SELECT` queries will run to show how to retrieve and filter data

- **Students**: Stores basic student info (ID, name, email)
